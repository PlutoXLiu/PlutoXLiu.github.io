In the coming week, our lab group is heading to the XI SCAR Open Science Conference 2024 in Pucón, Chile! We will have two talks and one poster to showcase what research we've been doing. And of course about Antarctica!
I will also stay at a collaborator's lab at the Universidad de Concepción for a whole month, doing some kelp freezing experiments :) Fingers crossed for exciting results!
